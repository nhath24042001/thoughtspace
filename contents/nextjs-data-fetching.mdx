## ðŸ§© Static Generation (SSG)

Static Generation means generating HTML at **build time**. The generated pages are then served as static files, which makes the site blazing fast and SEO-friendly.

### How to use

Use the `getStaticProps` function inside a page to fetch data at build time.

```tsx
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const res = await fetch("https://api.example.com/posts");
  const posts = await res.json();

  return {
    props: { posts }, // will be passed to the page component as props
  };
}
