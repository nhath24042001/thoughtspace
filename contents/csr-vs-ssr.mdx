# Client Components vs Server Components in Next.js 13+

With the release of **Next.js 13** and the introduction of the **App Router**, the concepts of **Client Components** and **Server Components** have become central to building performant and scalable web applications. This article explores their differences, use cases, and how to balance both effectively in a Next.js project.

## ⚙️ What are Server Components?

**Server Components** are React components rendered entirely on the server. They **do not include JavaScript** in the client bundle, meaning:

- They load faster (no client-side JS execution)
- Sensitive logic remains secure (not exposed in the browser)
- Better SEO support
- Direct access to secure backends and databases

```tsx
// app/page.tsx
export default async function HomePage() {
  const posts = await getPostsFromDB(); // Server-side only

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Latest Posts</h1>
      <ul>
        {posts.map((post) => (
          <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```
